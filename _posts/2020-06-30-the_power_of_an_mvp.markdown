A minimum viable product can help get information on where you need to add features and what users find the most important. Using the minimum viable product approach is extremely valuable because it keeps back feature creep, adding unnecessary features to a program.

In hindsight, I wish I had implemented the MVP approach more during this process, but I also believe that I stopped soon enough that it still counts. I added a lot more features to this site than I did to my last few, far exceeding the project's requirements. This was partly due to wanting to create something significant for my final project and also because this will be one of my projects the most likely actually to be deployed and used by people soon.

I think that stopping before adding user login allows it to be a form of an MVP as the user can decide whether they would prefer to treat it as a sort of wiki or have it be more personalized and contain their individualized content. However, if I had deeply held to that principle, I would not have added in the complete functionality.

When building a website, it is easy to think that every feature you can think of is a requirement that every styling adjustment will boost the user experience, but there is a lot that people do not notice. I spent a lot of time working on the padding for the different components, but I think that sticking to the bootstrap defaults would not have had a much different impact on the user experience. 

I think that design is a component of functionality, so if users come back and say that the design is a little ugly or drab, you can readjust. However, by starting with the minimum styling, you can keep from tweaking only to reduce later. Additionally, by limiting styling early on, you will be less attached to components that you decide to scrap.

In the end, we are creating websites for people to use, and the best way to keep from wasting our own time and theirs is to let them use them before the sites are perfect.
